# Linear-Algebra

Welcome to Amitai's little Linear Algebra calculator/program/thing.
Idea originally by Rom who started to work on something similar around the same I began my work on this.
This project implements concepts from the Linear Algebra 1 course I took a while back, using what I learned in the Software 1 course.
I decided to use C# since it has 2d arrays and supports operator overloading (gotta love operator overloading).
Later I might add a GUI for easier use, as well as some stuff from the succeeding course, Linear Algebra 2: Electric Boogaloo (but who knows if I'll actually do it...)
